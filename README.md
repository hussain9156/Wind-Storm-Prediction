# Wind-Storm-Prediction
This project helps to predict the number of hours remaining for the occurance of windstorm in U.S.A.
The data set has the columns with wind speed at different timings of the day.
Based on the rate of increment or decrement of speed of wind our algorithm predicts the number of hours remaining for the occurance of windstorm.
We have used linear regression model and trained it with our dataset.
